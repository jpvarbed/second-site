Are you tired of going to the same old spots every time you go out with friends? My group of friends in Seattle certainly was, so we decided to switch things up by making it a point to explore every neighborhood in the city. We'd get drinks at one place and dinner at another, and we'd research the best spots in each neighborhood to try out. Over time, we've visited a wide range of establishments and tried out a variety of food and drinks, from Italian restaurants and wine bars in Madrona to Canadian hockey sports bars in Greenwood. In this post, I'll be sharing some of our favorite spots from different Seattle neighborhoods, along with some brief notes and recommendations. Whether you're a Seattle local looking for new places to try or a visitor planning your itinerary, we hope this list will inspire you to explore some of the city's diverse food and drink offerings.

    - Trey
    - Dillon Choose Your Own Saki Cups

12. Wedgwood: Wedgewood Ale House which claimed everything was "best in town" but was just average. Fiddler's Inn was cute but average. Never returning. Made drinks.
13. Queen Anne: Tin Lizzie's which is a lounge in a hotel. Decent drinks but the crab dip needed more bread. We got kind of lit drinking one drink before dinner. We picked up some "The Cookie" from Metropolitan Markert and it was amazing. We drove up to Eden Hill. Because the wine was a lot and we were feeling it we didn't get any drinks but got 10 plates. We probably didn't need the second servings of the two proteins at the end. Drink goal not reached.

    - The Sexton (Southern cooking, a bourbon-focused bar & funky distressed furnishings for the 21-&-over crowd. Made drink limit

29. Edmonds 7/12/23: Jason, Sofia, John, Sonia, Andrew, Gavin. Dinner: Bar Dojo, Drinks:Kelnero bar. Dinner was very good but heavy. Asian fusion with lots of fats and oils. Would definitely go back. Kelnero had a brand new and thick cocktail menu. They warned us drinks would take a while as there was just one bartender and everything was new. It did take a while and the drinks we chose weren't the best but it was a fun bar and would go back. ![Group at Kelnero](/assets/images/blogs/nnn/nnn_29_group.png) ![Wings at Bar Dojo](/assets/images/blogs/nnn/nnn_29_food0.png) ![ube horchata](/assets/images/blogs/nnn/nnn_29_food1.png)
