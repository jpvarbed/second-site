## TOC

## First Half

Max Duggan is going to be a problem but Michigan will be able to run.

Michigan starts with the ball on the 25 after a touchback.

Edwards starts off with 70 yard run.

2 runs that get 4 yards. Tcu cheers on the stop but you know Michigan has a good 3rd down play in the tank.

Wilson on a long in and he comes up hurt.

Another dive by edwards and stokes come in for another dive. Michigan gets hit with a false start which doesn’t help michigans red zone issues. The wide receivers weren’t set.

3rd and long after the penalty tc blitzes the house and McCarthy scrambles to the 2 after running the whole field. Michigan decides to go for it. Everyone knows they are going for it. Calls a timeout and I think everyone takes an exhale.

Michigan tries a Philly special but there’s no one to throw it to. Bit of a mistake by Michigan.

TCU gets the ball at their 10 and tries a bomb. Will Johnson stops a 3rd and 2 pass conversion. Third game in a row the opponent avoids running it on third and short. To be fair to tcu they have an excellent running about.

I ordered buffalo hot wings and I got brought buffalo drenched chicken strips. I did not enjoy them but I panic ate them. Michigan starts at their 35th. Throws a pick 6 to bell. Mccarthy and bell are never on the same page in the first half.

Another early 3rd and 4. Johnson falls and falls incomplete. Wilson confirmed in the locker room. Punt goes to tcu’s 24. Michigan looks good down to down but has had bad luck early.

TCU gets the ball back after the 3rd and out. Converts on a long run and then converts a 3rd down on a duggan scramble. Sprits are a little split because you know being down 14-0 would be tough. Michigan hasn’t been losing by that much all year.

TCU has all day to throw and gets a 20 yard throw as Michigan only rushes 3.

Michigan had a chance on 3rd and 2 to get off the field but rod moore misses a tackle. 1st and 10 from the 11. Announcer talks about how good Michigan is in the red zone trying to put on the curse.

Michigan attacks the mesh but duggan keeps.TCU 3rd and 1 from the 2 and they convert for a 1st down. 1st and goal from the 1 is not good news. Duggan scores on a run from shotgun tcu up 14-0. The biggest deficit of the year

2:30 left in the 1st quarter.

Michigan gets the ball and tries a hennaing end around but zinger misses his first block of the season.

Next play schoonmaker on a post for 40 yards. Gives Michigan some life. Schoonmaker might be hurt which is bad for a team already on their 3rd te.

I’m already worried about Michigan in the red zone. Dan mentions that we should never throw to the wr’s.

Goes into the 2nd quarter 2nd and 5 at the 25.

Michigan gets stuffed on 2 straight runs and kicks a field goal. The concerns about stalling the red zone validated.

Michigan needs to figure out the run blitz. A late releasing lb gets in twice after the rest of the play is perfectly blocked.

Michigan rushes 3 and deflects a ball. Michigan comes up with the pick.

Michigan turns around and throws a 51 td on the next play to Wilson. The whole vibe switches. They are reviewing the catch but he bobbles it into the end zone.

They reverse the call and Michigan fumbles on the next play.

TCU converts a rushing first down and then fails to convert on 3rd and 4.

Saw a tweet that said if fields were 98 yards long then Michigan is winning now. It hurts

Michigan throws to edwards who can catch which is good news because of his cast. It’s the 3rd time he lets lose of the ball after hitting the ground though

Bell drops the ball again. Bell sucks

Michigan is getting pressure on tcu every down. They are hitting the rb behind the line but tcu is finding ways to make positive plays. It sucks that michigans d has to play so perfect with all the mistakes the offense is making.

TCU runs a zone read and duggan goes for 8 which is a pretty good result given how bad it could have gone.

Michigan pressures again on 3rd and 2 but misses the tackle as his slips on the turf. The turf slipping has come up several times.

1st and goal from the 7 for tcu. Tcu scores on a slant as duggan is being tackled.

Everything that can go wrong has gone wrong and then some. 4:56 left in the 2nd quarter

Michigan gets to middle field in their last drive of the half. They hit another false start, get a sacked and then a good throw to Loveland on 3rd and 20 is tipped. Michigan punts 1:36 left in the half. The game feels more or less over unless in the second half the whole luck switches. TCU starts with the ball and if they score on the first drive it feels like it’ll be hard to make it up.

Michigan gets the first sack of the game to close up the half. They make a drive with 40 seconds left. A bomb heaved is interfered with and Michigan kicks a 59 fg. The longest in Michigan history.

## Half Time

Michigan is down for the biggest deficit of the season for the biggest game of their program. Everything has gone wrong turning it over more than any other game. TCU is the worse team but they are getting breaks at the right time. They start the 2nd half with the ball but I do feel that if Michigan can stop them and score the vibes of the game will switch.

The experts talk about how the call was bad, Michigan was inside the 5 twice with no points and threw a pick 6.

## Second Half

We did double shots for the double td deficit.

Tcu starts with a qb draw

Michigan plays a suffering 2nd half defense on their first drive

Michigan converts their first first down on a long throw to Wilson after an edwards run to the edge gets stuffed for 2.

50 yard pass to bell. Dan goes in the restroom for good luck.

Michigan settles for a fg from the 5. Red zone issues plague forever.

TCU runs it 3 times in a row for a 1st down. Their starting rb is out with an injury like michigan.

TCU has 3rd and 10. Tcu receiver misses and um comes down with the ball. Sanistril number #0 who played wr for 3 years comes down with the ball. The michigan defense is shutting down tcu in a big way.

Michigan calls a flea flicker after a 1st down and michigan hits a long td to bell

21-16 michigan with 6:32 left. It’s a game.

Michigan blitzes sanistril on the tcu’s first play and they get their longest play of the game 46 yards. Tcu follows up with a 12 yard rush up the middle. It’s ruining the comeback. Michigan needs to harden up in the red zone to make this a game.

Jason is stressed. He’s got the murder eyes. Will report back later.

3rd and 2 on at the 6. The game can really turn here.

1st and goal at the 1 for tcu and they run it in.

4:25 left in the 3rd.

Schoonmaker did go out

McCarthy throws another pick 6.

Edwards was wide open on the other side. McCarthy is really losing this game for Michigan.

McCarthy runs twice and michigan scores a td. Michigan fails on the 2 pt conversion

Tcu runs it in with two explosive runs by the backup rb. I don’t understand what’s happening. It looks like Michigan is blitzing and missing.

Michigan comes back with another long td but then they review it short then michigan converts on a dive. Michigan goes for 2 and converts successfully.

Tcu gets the ball back and they may have fumbled? It goes to review yet again. These reviews are really killing Michigan.

We got another round of shots just before the possible fumble

Michigan converts on the td in 2 plays and then another 2 point conversion. We’re losing it. Tcu fans are distraught. Edwards run for 9 and then a Wilson 18 yard run

14:14 left in the fourth quarter. The chairs are out. It feels like tcu is trying to hide

Duggan is 9/23 and tcu is winning. Tcu is getting pressured on every down. Duggan is very uncomfortable. TCU converts on a blitz for a td.

Michigan goes 3 and out on the next drive after getting a bunch of pressure

Terrible fucking punt by brad again and tcu gets the ball on the 20. Duggan rushes for 2.

Tcu kicks a fg for 33 51-38 tcu with 10:02 left.

Michigan gets the ball back with 10 minutes. I assume tcu is going to rush 3 all game and prevent any explosive games. Basically play prevent. First play michigan overthrows the about. They are making michigan avoid the run. Loveland drops the second. Michigan punts which is insane. Tcu gets the ball with 8:50 left but forces a 3 and out on tcu. Michigan gets the ball back with 6:46 left

Michigan cores with 3:18 left in 3:28. Down 51-45. Michigan needs a stop and then to score. It’s still possible but stopping tcu has proved elusive so far.

Michigan fakes an onside kick but kicks it to the 1 so the return it to the 10.

TCU does a Duggan dive for 2 yards but doesn’t call a timeout. I think this is good read. Somehow tcu gets it to 3rd and 1 on a run. That is really the game there. Tcu converts. Stops them for 2nd and 8 with 1:08 left calls 1 of 3 timeouts.

3rd and 4 for the game possibly (michigan would still need to score)

Tcu chooses to throw it to quinton Johnson for a wr screen and michigan stops it and uses their last timeout. 59 seconds left. 4th and 1 left fuck that is a good idea. They have gotten more than 1 on every play. I support it. Tcu was just bluffing trying to force michigan into an offsides. Instead it’s a false start for michigan

Michigan will get the ball with a chance to win which was not a given for how this game went the rest.

Michigan gets the ball at 22 with 52 seconds left

Michigan false starts at 3rd and 5. Michigan is just out of sorts all game.

4th and 10. Center snaps the ball before jj is ready and that’s game.

## Post Game

It’s a disappointing result with the all the unforced errors. Michigan didn’t play their best game and you want that for such a big game. The refs also absolutely made a terrible call pulling off the td. Michigan shouldn’t have fumbled though.
