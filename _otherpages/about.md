I've been a developer for over a decade, with experience in both front-end and back-end development. Over the course of my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, including mobile network stacks, UI frameworks, microservices, apps, and enterprise software.

I am passionate about building high-quality, scalable software that solves real-world problems and makes people's lives easier. My expertise includes C++, Typescript, Go, Python, React, React Native, AWS, and more. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

## Recommendations

### [Alex Strand - Founder/Ceo at Stately Cloud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-strand-165714/)

> Jason is a skilled engineer who excels in technical expertise, leadership and communication. When we started working together, it was his first time as a tech lead for a larger project in scope, people, and tech. However, he quickly adapted and learned how to break down the work into different phases and how to efficiently bring on new team members without slowing down delivery.
> Throughout the project, Jason communicated effectively with both leadership and his team, ensuring everyone was on the same page and working towards the same goals. He was a technical resource and leader for his team, which allowed me to focus on other parts of the project knowing that I could trust that his team would deliver what was promised with high quality code. It was a pleasure to work with Jason and I highly recommend him for any project or team. I trust that any company will benefit from his technical acumen and leadership skills

### [Hélène Causse - Senior VP Of Eng at FIS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenecausse/)

> Jason has a deep understanding of how to improve app performance and reduce latency for data-intensive applications. During his time at Snapchat, he played a key role in the messaging rewrite project, where he was able to decrease the load latency of the app's main page by 50%. Jason is not only a talented engineer, but he is also a team player who is receptive to feedback and always looking for ways to improve himself and his team. It was a pleasure to work with him and I would highly recommend him for any project or team.

### [Dennis Quintela - Director Of Eng at Upstart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisq/)

> Jason rises to the challenge of difficult, open-ended tasks. During his time at Snapchat, I often turned to him whenever we needed to accomplish a complex project. He has shipped the first C++ QUIC GRPC network stack in an app, designed our messaging client API, and figured out how to save a significant amount of money in our new messaging protocol.
> Jason has an excellent ability to provide excellent insights on how a large organization should prioritize its efforts. During our messaging rewrite project, for example, we were faced with the challenge of deciding how to break up the work and product. Jason not only came up with a presentation outlining how we could talk to the new server and old server, but also provided a solution for how we could slowly switch APIs over. His insights and expertise were invaluable to the success of the project, and it was a pleasure to work with him.
